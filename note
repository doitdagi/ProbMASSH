Reasoner Agent
-------------------------------------
- we implement two scenarios 
		I. one involves uncertainty reasoning, that is "turn on the light" user command without specifying which light to turn on
		   - this scenario do not involve negotiation
		II. The second one involves negotiation of information between different room's negotiator agents 
- The reasoner agent makes decision when
        I. it receive user command 
        II. or it detects a change environment
